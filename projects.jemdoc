*Two-party Privacy Decision Tree Algorithm* is an extended algorithm based on traditional ID3 algorithm. It fits better on the situation that taking personal privacy into consideration. In this project, we proposed a jointly decision tree construction algorithm(on two-party case) to resolve the conflict that two parties want to build a decision tree based on their data, meanwhile keep their own data private.
